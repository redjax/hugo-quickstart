# Hugo Quickstart

This is a demo site built with [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator written in Go. This site is my sandbox/testbed for Hugo projects.

Check out the [`notes`](/notes/) section for notes on setting up & configuring `hugo`, or the [`posts`](/posts/) section for example blog posts.
